# Project Documentation: Multi-Agent Data Analysis System

## Project Overview

This Streamlit prototype implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for automated data analysis. The system demonstrates how different AI agents can work together to process user queries, analyze data, and generate meaningful insights with visualizations.

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Agent Communication Flow
```
User Input → File Ingestion Agent → Query Understanding Agent → Data Analysis Agent → Visualization Agent → Response Generation Agent → Output
```

### Core Components

#### 1. FileIngestionAgent
**Purpose**: Handle file uploads and data preprocessing
**Methods**:
- `ingest_file()`: Reads various file formats and returns DataFrame
- `get_column_metadata()`: Extracts column types and metadata

**Supported File Types**:
- CSV files with automatic delimiter detection
- Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) with sheet processing
- Text files with basic content analysis

#### 2. QueryUnderstandingAgent
**Purpose**: Parse natural language queries into structured analysis plans
**Methods**:
- `parse_query()`: Converts user queries to JSON analysis plans

**Query Pattern Recognition**:
- Aggregation queries (sum, average, count)
- Grouping and categorization
- Statistical distributions
- Time series analysis (when applicable)

#### 3. DataAnalysisAgent
**Purpose**: Execute pandas operations based on query plans
**Methods**:
- `execute_analysis()`: Performs data analysis based on structured plans

**Supported Operations**:
- Mathematical aggregations (sum, mean, count)
- Group-by operations with multiple aggregation methods
- Statistical summaries and distributions
- Data filtering and transformation

#### 4. VisualizationAgent
**Purpose**: Generate matplotlib chart code dynamically
**Methods**:
- `generate_chart_code()`: Creates Python code for charts

**Chart Types**:
- Bar charts for categorical data
- Line charts for trends and sequences
- Histograms for distributions
- Scatter plots for correlations

#### 5. ResponseGenerationAgent
**Purpose**: Format comprehensive responses with text and visualizations
**Methods**:
- `generate_response()`: Combines analysis results with charts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Session State Management
The application uses Streamlit's session state to maintain:
- `data`: Current DataFrame being analyzed
- `column_metadata`: Column type information
- `analysis_history`: Previous queries and results
- `current_file`: Name of currently loaded file

### Error Handling
- Graceful file upload error handling
- Data analysis error recovery
- Chart generation fallback mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient DataFrame operations using pandas
- Matplotlib figure cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Lazy loading of large datasets
- Optimized chart rendering

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Workflow
1. Upload data file using sidebar
2. Review automatic data profiling
3. Enter natural language query
4. Review multi-agent processing steps
5. Analyze results and visualizations

### Example Query Types

#### Aggregation Queries
- "What is the total sales?"
- "Calculate the average revenue"
- "Count the number of customers"

#### Grouping Queries
- "Show sales by region"
- "Break down revenue by product category"
- "Group customers by type"

#### Statistical Queries
- "Show me the distribution of ages"
- "Create a histogram of prices"
- "What are the summary statistics?"

### Advanced Features

#### Analysis History
- Automatic tracking of previous queries
- Timestamped results storage
- Query plan preservation for debugging

#### Data Profiling
- Automatic column type detection
- Statistical summaries
- Data quality indicators

- Enterprise SSO integration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each agent individually
- Validate data processing functions
- Check error handling paths

### Integration Testing

- Verify chart generation accuracy

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **File Upload Fails**: Check file format and size
2. **Query Not Understood**: Use simpler, more direct language
3. **Charts Not Displaying**: Check matplotlib configuration
4. **Performance Issues**: Reduce data size or optimize queries

### Debug Mode
Enable debug information by setting:
```python
st.set_option('client.showErrorDetails', True)
```

### Log Analysis
Check Streamlit logs for:
- File processing errors
- Query parsing issues
- Chart generation problems
- Session state conflicts
