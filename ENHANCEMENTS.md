# Enhanced Multi-Agent Data Analysis System - Changelog

## ðŸš€ Major Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Column Name Recognition**
- **Smart Column Detection**: The system now intelligently finds column names mentioned in user queries
- **Synonym Support**: Recognizes business terms and synonyms (e.g., "revenue" maps to "Sales", "customers" maps to "Customer_Name")
- **Partial Matching**: Handles partial column name matches and compound column names with underscores
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Uses a scoring system to find the best matching column when multiple possibilities exist

### 2. **Expanded Query Operations**
- **New Operations Added**:
  - `max` - Find maximum values
  - `min` - Find minimum values
  - `unique` - Count unique values
  - `value_counts` - Show frequency distribution of categorical data
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: More descriptive analysis results
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases

### 3. **Improved User Interface**
- **Column Reference Panel**: Shows available columns categorized by type (Numeric, Categorical, Text)
- **Dynamic Example Queries**: Examples now use actual column names from uploaded data
- **Analysis Plan Visualization**: Shows detected columns and operations in the query plan
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Users can see which column was detected from their query

### 4. **Advanced Visualization**
- **Better Chart Styling**: Enhanced matplotlib charts with professional styling
- **Statistical Overlays**: Histograms now show mean lines and statistics
- **Improved Chart Types**: Better handling of grouped data and value counts
- **Responsive Design**: Charts adapt better to different data types

### 5. **Enhanced Business Intelligence**
- **Extended Synonym Dictionary**: Covers more business terms:
  - Sales: revenue, income, earnings, turnover
  - Quantity: units, pieces, volume, amount
  - Customer: client, buyer, consumer, purchaser
  - Region: territory, zone, district, area
  - And many more...

## ðŸ“Š Example Query Transformations

### Before Enhancement:
```
User: "What is the total sales?"
System: Uses first numeric column found (generic)
```

### After Enhancement:
```
User: "What is the total sales?"
System: 
âœ… Detects "Sales" column specifically
âœ… Applies SUM operation to correct column
âœ… Shows "Detected Column: Sales" in analysis plan
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Results

The enhanced system successfully handles queries like:
- âœ… "What is the total **revenue**?" â†’ Maps to Sales/Revenue columns
- âœ… "Show **sales** by **region**" â†’ Groups Sales by Region columns
- âœ… "Count **customers**" â†’ Counts Customer-related columns
- âœ… "Maximum **quantity**" â†’ Finds max in Quantity columns
- âœ… "Unique **product categories**" â†’ Shows unique values in Product columns

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: Users can speak naturally about their data
